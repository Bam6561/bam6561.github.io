[Description]

Lucyfer Bot is a chatroom bot programmed for Discord with the ability to pull 
Discord-API exclusive information about users & guilds, play games, create embeds, 
clear messages, and perform other miscellaneous tasks impossible to be performed 
by human users or tenuous tasks to do by hand.

Provided below is a link to the github directory of the discord bot.

[To Do]

I plan to add additional features to the discord bot as well as 
improve its functionality where I can in my free time.

Example planned features:

- Connecting to voice channels 
- Playing audio from links or attachments
- Additional outside API interaction (Spotify, Genius, Google, etc.)
