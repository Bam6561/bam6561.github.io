[Description]

Starfallen is a top-down 2D vertically scrolling bullet hell shooter
video game that puts the player in control of a starship fighting 
against an invading alien fleet. Pilots must manuever their starcraft 
through the world collecting different weapons, power-ups, and 
special abilities to assist them in their fight. The game is
currently under development by myself and two other
individuals. The game will be written in GameMaker Studio 2.
